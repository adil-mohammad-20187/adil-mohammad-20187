Hi there! 👋
I'm Adil and I'm a self-taught data scientist. I'm especially interested in the intersection of data science 📊 and sustainability 🌍.

On my GitHub profile, I share some of my projects which include building a portfolio website 💻, doing time series forecasting for bike sharing data 🚲
👩‍🎓 I have worked on multiple projects using almost every ML algorithm available. But as i said self-taught.
